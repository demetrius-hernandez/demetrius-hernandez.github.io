As drones become more accessible and affordable, the threat they pose to national security and public safety
is increasing. Counter drone systems are essential for mitigating these risks, but evaluating their effectiveness
can be challenging due to the complex interactions between different elements of the system. In this paper, I
propose a graph-theoretic approach to modelling counter drone systems. I begin by reviewing the key features
of counter drone systems and the challenges associated with their design and evaluation. I then introduce
graph theory and explain how it can be used to model the interactions between different components of a
counter drone system. Furthermore, I show how counter drone systems can be analysed using graph-theoretic
metrics such as centrality, connectivity, and resilience.

The results show that graph-theoretic approaches can provide valuable insights into the design and evaluation
of counter drone systems. By modelling the system as a graph, the critical components that are most vulnerable
to attack can be identified and evaluated for the impact of different mitigation strategies on the systems overall
resilience. Despite the limitations of graph-theoretic approaches and the challenges of applying them in
practice, such as the need for accurate data and the difficulty of modelling complex interactions, this work
demonstrates the potential of graph-theoretic approaches to improve the design and evaluation of counter
drone systems.
