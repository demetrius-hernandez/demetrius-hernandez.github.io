I am a first-year PhD student at the [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu/) in the Computer Science and Engineering department, where my research focuses on autonomous drones for emergency response scenarios.

I am a [National Science Foundation (NSF) Computer and Information Science and Engineering Graduate Research Fellow (CSGrad4US)](https://new.nsf.gov/cise/graduate-fellowships) and a Phase 3 [Department of Defense (DoD) Science, Mathematics, and Research for Transformation (SMART) Scholar](https://www.smartscholarship.org/smart/en), working under the guidance of [Dr. Jane Cleland-Huang](https://engineering.nd.edu/faculty/jane-cleland-huang/).
