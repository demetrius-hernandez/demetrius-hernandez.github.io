I am a first-year PhD student at the University of Notre Dame in the Computer Science and Engineering department, where my research focuses on autonomous drones for emergency response scenarios.

I am a National Science Foundation (NSF) Computer and Information Science and Engineering Graduate Research Fellow (CSGrad4US) and a Phase 3 Department of Defense (DoD) Science, Mathematics, and Research for Transformation (SMART) Scholar, working under the guidance of Dr. Jane Cleland-Huang.
