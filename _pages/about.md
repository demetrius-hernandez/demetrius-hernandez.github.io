I am a first-year PhD student at the University of Notre Dame in the Computer Science and Engineering department. 

I am a National Science Foundation (NSF) Computer and Information Science and Engineering Graduate Research Fellow (CSGrad4US) and a Department of Defense (DoD) Science, Mathematics, and Research for Transformation (SMART) Scholar. Under the guidance of Dr. Jane Cleland-Huang, my research is focused on autonomous drones for emergency response scenarios.
